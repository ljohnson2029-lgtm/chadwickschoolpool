        question: "What's the difference between Student and Parent accounts?",

      },
      {
        question: "How do I link my student account to my parent?",

        question: "How do I send a ride request to another parent?",

      },
      {

      },
      {
        question: "How do I cancel a ride?",

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why can't I create carpools?",
    answer: "Only parent accounts can create and manage carpools. Student accounts can view their linked parent's carpools but cannot create their own. This is for safety and to ensure all carpools are managed by verified adults."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I link my child's account?",
    answer: "Your child (student) needs to send a link request from their account using your email address. You'll receive a notification to approve the request. Once approved, they can view your carpools and you can manage rides on their behalf."
